Why IDs sometimes "skip" in DBs:
Deleted records:

If a flight record was deleted, its ID is gone forever.

Example: If flight with ID 13859 was deleted â†’ you'll see 13858, 13860 but no 13859.

Failed insertions:
Sometimes a new flight is created but the insert fails (e.g., database error).
The ID counter still goes up, but the data never lands in the table.
Batch insert/update issues:
When inserting a big batch of flights, some might fail validation or duplication checks.
IDs might already be reserved before the check happens.

Manual corrections:
In production databases, sometimes admins manually clean up weird flights
(like test flights) and remove rows.
